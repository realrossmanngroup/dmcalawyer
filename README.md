## why this exists

I run a nonprofit focused on reforming Section 1201 of the DMCA. That's the law that makes it a federal crime to circumvent digital locks, even when no copyright infringement is involved. I've testified before legislatures & spent years working to change this law because it restricts peoples' right to repair, to do security research, & to make fair use of content they've legally accessed.

Newman's lawsuit includes a Section 1201 circumvention claim against someone for downloading publicly available YouTube videos & using clips in commentary. If this theory succeeds in court, it could set a precedent that using yt-dlp, OBS, a screen recorder, or any other tool to capture a public YouTube video for use in criticism or commentary is a federal offense. That's every react channel, video essayist who includes a clip, or journalist who embeds footage in a report. That's the precedent this case is trying to set.

So I looked into the attorney pushing this theory. What I found was an attorney who tells people to kill themselves on Discord, harasses disabled people on his business accounts, contacts represented parties through intermediaries to extract case information, solicits clients in ways he openly admits violate the rules, & publishes peoples' home addresses on YouTube.

This complaint documents all of it with screenshots & citations to the specific professional conduct rules each act violates.

## what this complaint covers

**1. Encouraging suicide.** Newman repeatedly told people to kill themselves in Discord messages, doubled down when called out, privately acknowledged to another user that this could get him disbarred, & then weeks later posted a meme of a person hanging themselves. Potentially criminal under New York Penal Law Section 120.30 & California Penal Code Section 401.

**2. Contacting a represented party.** Newman used a third party (Peter Coventry) to extract case-related information from the defendant, knowing the defendant was represented by counsel. He went around opposing counsel instead of through them. This is a textbook Rule 4.2 violation in both New York & California.

**3. Improper solicitation.** Newman directly tagged & messaged potential clients on YouTube & Discord, telling them to email him if they wanted "in on the action." He admitted on a livestream that he knew direct solicitation was against the rules. He did it anyway.

**4. Harassment of opposing parties & third parties.** Newman used his business social media accounts to create degrading AI-generated images mocking the defendant's appearance, mock the defendant's wife's appearance, mock disabled people in wheelchairs (calling them "lame gimps" & "broke losers"), & run a months-long campaign of AI-generated content targeting another person's Christian faith.

**5. Doxxing.** Newman published the defendant's full residential address on his YouTube channel without redaction & bragged about "unmasking" him.

## why does this matter beyond one bad lawyer?

If you're an attorney, you are held to professional conduct rules. You agreed to follow them when you got your license. If you're going to use the legal system to punish someone for using 30 extra seconds of a YouTube clip, you don't get to simultaneously break the rules that govern your own profession on your own business accounts.

This isn't about being a tattletale. It's about holding someone to the same standard they hold everyone else to. Newman is trying to set a legal precedent that would criminalize how millions of people use the internet, & he's doing it while telling people to kill themselves & mocking disabled people on his business YouTube channel. The bar exists to deal with exactly this kind of conduct.
